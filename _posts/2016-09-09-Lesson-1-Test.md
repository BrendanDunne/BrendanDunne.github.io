    <td>Over the year I feel that i learned effectively and properly. I employed a variety of strategies that had a varying degree of results. I employed the use of the internet often using W3Schools as a guide to help polish my website. I also occasionally used StackOverflow to help me on my path. A third way i used to overcome problems was to ask my peers for help - Rob and Ben especially were great at giving me hints but not the outright answers. However, I tried to rely on myself most of all as it teaches me to work independently and not rely on others.</td>

    <td>I feel not much limited my learning and i worked effectively and positively throughout the year. I just need to make sure not to rely on everyone else as its my work, not theirs.</td>
