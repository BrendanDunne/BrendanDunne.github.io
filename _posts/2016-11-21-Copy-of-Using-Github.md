    <td>For the start of the lesson there was no introduction or anything. All our teacher said was "You know what to do". Of course, we all did and immediately got down to working on our blog website designs.. First of all, I fixed any problems with my blog to do with colours, glitches or anything I didn't like. Well, I tried to. I faced the fearsome foe of Error 504. It meant that too many people were trying to make changes to their websites and GitHub couldn't manage it so it threw up the error. Therefore, I did try very hard to make changes to my website but I couldn't. So I did what I could and resolved to try and do it after the lesson when there wouldn't be as many people trying to make changes to their blogs.</td>

    <td>The most obvious limit to my learning was encountering the problems of Error 504. The problem was, you couldn't do anything about it. It was unbelievably annoying. Normally, there is always something you could fix or change. Today however, there was nothing you could do but sit there frustratingly and hope the change would actually work. Even the most simple thing like making the background work would be too much for GitHub to handle. I just had to sit and hope for the best with that. However, there was another limit to my learning which came from the problems of Error 504. That was too much talking, not enough working. While I waited for GitHub to do its thing I would end up talking to my mates. But then, when GitHub had done its thing, I wouldn't notice and waste valuable time. Although this problem was noticed by my teacher though and was easily fixed by just not talking.</td>

    <td>Since there will be no next time I will not be able to write too much here. I will, however still be able to write about what I would change if I had to do this exercise again. First of all I would try and put a lot more time and effort in to make sure I did the best job I could do. I would also try and write my blogs in a much readable style and not just saying what happened in simple terms like most of the blogs I had written. Also, try and check all grammar problems and make sure my sentences are actually coherent. For an example of incoherent sentences, just have a look at my previous blog. I am sure you will have a good laugh over the absolute failure of that particular post. Finally, I would try and use W3Schools a LOT more to help improve my understanding of the code and maybe help me implement more complicated and cooler code.
