    <td>During the lesson, we mostly talked about optical illusions and how easy it is to trick your eyes. This is because we are programmed to compare things, not just look at them which gives us our depth perception. However, this is not always a nice thing to have as your brain can easily be tricked into seeing something that does not make much sense but because your brain compares things, not just looks at them. Back to the actual programming though. We were trying to create the code for a python program that responds and has a short conversation with you. Since, we had previously studied Python, I mostly learnt by trying to recall all that I needed to complete the task.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning this lesson was not very much. Although, you could say I probably spent too much time wondering about optical illusions, not the actual Python but that was not too bad. </td>

    <td>Next time, I will try to focus more on the work not just the interesting start of the lesson. Also, I could practice coding more often so it becomes easier to recall all the coding I need to write fluently in that programming language.</td>
