    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by recalling past use of Python and trying to utilise all available help, such as w3schools and other students. Also, the worksheets were helpful and were simple to follow. This made the work easier to do and understand.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I do not think very much limited my learning this lesson. Something that could have limited my learning was that I had done little to no practice of Python recently so I had to try hard to remember how to form the program correctly.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will practice programming more often to stay up to date on all that I need to know. This will also enable me to stay fluent in the program.</td>
