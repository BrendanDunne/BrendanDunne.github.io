    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by using my intellect to solve simple problems and occasionally asking for a tip on how to solve something, but no the answer. This was effective and helped me learn properly. It also allowed me to remember how to do it for next time.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I hampered my own learning by asking for tips and instead getting answers which didn't help me learn but did help me reach my target.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change my outlook on school due to a speech given by our teacher in the lesson. A few choice words were said by him and so I changed my views on homework and schoolwork. A few things he said were that we always take the easiest route to doing something, not making it look good, but just getting enough done. We always try to ask others for help as soon as we stumble across a small problem. And so I endeavour to try and make all my work from now on look good and not as if I did it on the way to school.</td>
