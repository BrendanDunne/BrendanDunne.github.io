    <td>I learnt by watching the teacher do something and taking notes. I would then try and replicate that same thing. If it went wrong you would have to try and fix it yourself. A couple of my effective strategies were trial and error, using common logic thinking and if i am really stuck, asking my friends for a bit of help.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>One thing that especially limits my learning is helping other people as it is very time consuming and they often don't understand what I mean, causing me to have to spend extra time working on their website, instead of mine. In need to work on the habit of thinking logically as i occasionally struggle with this.</td>
