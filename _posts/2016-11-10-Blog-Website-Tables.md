    <td>I learnt by watching what our teacher did and then asking any questions I had. Next I would look at suggested websites that would help me achieve my target. After that, I would try and do it myself on this website without messing everything up.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

    <td>I limited my learning by not listening properly and by helping other people. This limited me due to me not having ample time to do everything I wanted to.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will change my tables to be a bit better and also make sure to take enough notes to do everything easily. I will also try to not help others as much, to help them learn efficiently.</td>
